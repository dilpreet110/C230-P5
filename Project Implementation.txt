Project Proposal: Dilpreet Singh Sidhu

Premise:
For my project, I plan to develop an arcade-style brick breaker game using p5.js references and other refernces available on internet. The game will involve a paddle, a ball, and bricks that the ball must break through. I chose this project because it's a classic game that offers a good balance of simplicity and complexity, making it suitable for implementation within the given timeframe.Throughout the project, I aim to learn more about game physics, collision detection, and user interaction.

Features List:

Required Features	                                     Desired Features
Paddle that moves horizontally	                  Sound effects for collisions and actions
Ball that bounces off walls and paddle   	Different levels with increasing difficulty
Bricks that break upon collision with ball	Power-ups (e.g., paddle size increase, multi-ball)
Score tracking and display	                Customizable paddle and ball appearance
Lives tracking and game over condition
High score leaderboard

Milestone Timeline:

Week 1: Set up project structure, create basic game layout with paddle, ball, and bricks.
Week 2: Implement ball physics, collision detection with walls and paddle.
Week 3: Add brick breaking functionality, score tracking, and lives system.
Week 4: Integrate sound effects, design additional levels with increasing difficulty.
Week 5: Implement power-ups and fine-tune game mechanics.
Week 6: Polish user interface, optimize performance, and finalize project.

Project Team:

This project will be developed by me only.
